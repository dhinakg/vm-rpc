#@Version-Info
#
# VixAllProducts revision mapping
#
# This file translates product version specifications into the appropriate Vix
# implementations.
#
# Each @Version-Info line has 5 white-space seperated entries:
#
#    provider-type: ws, esx, viserver, etc
#    apiVersion: the apiVersion supported, as passed in from VixHost_Connect()
#    ipc-type: none, vmdb, vmodl, cim
#    product-version: the product version string
#
#    implementation-directory: the path to the library that implements the
#          version described by the first 4 parameters
#
#
# The configuration is based on the first 4 fields, which describe
# the product.  The 5th field is the location.  To force it to try
# multiple location, the same configuration can be repeated.  Note that
# list is built in LIFO order, so the latest entry in the configuration
# will be the first used.  If for some reason that value fails, it will
# continue through any other matches.
